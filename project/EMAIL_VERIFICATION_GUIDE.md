# Email Verification Flow Implementation

## Overview
The email verification system has been implemented to handle email verification links sent to users after registration. When users click the verification link in their email, they are redirected to the frontend with a verification token, which is then processed automatically.

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. API Integration (`src/services/api.ts`)
- Added `verifyEmail(token: string)` function to `authApi`
- Calls the backend endpoint: `GET /api/auth/verify-email?token={token}`
- Returns success/error response from the backend

### 2. Email Verification Component (`src/components/EmailVerification.tsx`)
- Modal component that displays verification status
- Shows loading spinner during verification process
- Displays success message with login redirect button
- Shows error message if verification fails
- Automatically calls the verification API when mounted

### 3. App Integration (`src/App.tsx`)
- Checks URL parameters on page load for `action=verify-email&token={token}`
- Automatically shows EmailVerification modal when verification parameters are detected
- Cleans the URL after extracting parameters to prevent duplicate processing
- Provides handlers for closing modal and redirecting to login

### 4. URL Parameter Handling
The system expects verification URLs in this format:
```
https://yoursite.com/?action=verify-email&token=abc123xyz
```

When users click such a link:
1. The App component detects the parameters
2. Extracts the token and sets verification state
3. Shows the EmailVerification modal
4. Cleans the URL for better UX

## Backend Implementation

### 1. AuthController Updates (`AuthController.java`)
- Added alternative endpoints for frontend compatibility:
  - `POST /api/auth/login` (aliases to `/signin`)
  - `POST /api/auth/register` (aliases to `/signup`)
  - `GET /api/auth/me` (aliases to `/validate`)
- Existing email verification endpoint: `GET /api/auth/verify-email?token={token}`

### 2. AuthService (`AuthService.java`)
- `verifyEmail(String token)` method handles token verification
- Updates user's email verification status in database
- Removes verification token after successful verification

## Email Template Requirements

The verification emails sent by your backend should include links in this format:

```html
<a href="https://yourfrontend.com/?action=verify-email&token={{VERIFICATION_TOKEN}}">
  Verify Your Email Address
</a>
```

Replace:
- `https://yourfrontend.com/` with your actual frontend URL
- `{{VERIFICATION_TOKEN}}` with the actual verification token

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Register a new user account
2. Check the verification email (or database for the token)
3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/?action=verify-email&token=YOUR_TOKEN`
4. The verification modal should appear automatically
5. Verify the API call is made and status is updated

### Test Component
A test component (`EmailVerificationTest.tsx`) has been created to help test the flow:
- Generates sample verification URLs
- Provides buttons to test the verification flow
- Shows the expected URL format

To use the test component, import and render it in your app during development.

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Validation**: Tokens should be cryptographically secure and have expiration times
2. **One-Time Use**: Tokens should be invalidated after successful verification
3. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production for verification links
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting on the verification endpoint

## Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:
- Invalid or expired tokens
- Network failures
- Backend service unavailability
- Missing tokens in URL

All errors are displayed to the user with appropriate messages and options to retry or contact support.

## Flow Diagram

```
User Registration → Email Sent → User Clicks Link → Frontend Detects URL → 
API Call to Backend → Database Update → Success/Error Message → 
Optional Login Redirect
```

## Configuration

Make sure your environment variables are set correctly:
- `VITE_API_URL`: Your backend API base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/api`)
- Backend should be configured to send emails with the correct frontend URL

## Next Steps

1. Configure your email service to use the correct verification URL format
2. Test the complete flow from registration to verification
3. Add any additional styling or branding to the verification modal
4. Consider adding analytics tracking for verification success/failure rates
